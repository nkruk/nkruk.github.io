This is just a test, but let's answer the question while we are here, check out this link:
https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll

You don't even remember how to run this locally, don't you?

{% highlight ruby %}
bundle exec jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

Ah, but if you're running a ruby version > 3.1.2 then you're screwed. 
Switch to 3.1.2 (using your beloved chruby).
